# Marmot coupling

The export controlled mesoscale fuel performance code Marmot is set up to
include Magpie to couple radiation damage in mesoscale (phase field)
simulations. Make sure Magpie is up and running first by following the main
[installation instructions](/Installation.md).

Assuming your Magpie folder is located at `~/projects/magpie` as suggested set
the `MAGPIE_DIR` environment variable as follows :

```
export MAGPIE_DIR=~/projects/magpie
```

Now enter your Marmot directory and build Marmot as usual.
