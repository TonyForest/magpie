A block-structured AMR scheme provides this capability without sacrificing the numerical and computational efficiencies associated with regular meshes. In this article we describe an AMR implementation of the discrete ordinates method for radiative transfer, coupled with an existing projection method for low-Mach-number flows. The complete algorithm constitutes a conservative scheme for unsteady combined-mode heat transfer. Results for two-and three-dimensional examples are shown.},
